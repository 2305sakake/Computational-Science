# Computational Science Projects
This is a list of projects I have done to simulate various physical phenomena and investigate topics in computational science. Although I say computational science, there is a heavy focus on computational physics projects as that is my main interest. Most projects are also done on Python with a few exceptions done on MATLAB.
